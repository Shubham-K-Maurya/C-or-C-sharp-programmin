                                                          Assignment#1(C#)


1.	The total distance travelled by a vehicle in t seconds is given by
              		Distance=ut+ (at2)/2
Where u is the initial velocity (meter per second) a is acceleration (meter per second2). Write a program to evaluate the distance travel at regular intervals of time, given the value of u and a. The program should provide the flexibility to the user to select his own time intervals and repeat the calculations for different value of u and a.





2.	In Inventory Management, the Economic Order Quantity for a single item is given by
                EOQ=√ (2*demand rate*setup costs)/holding cost per item per unit time
	And the optimal Time between orders:
                TBO=√ (2*setup cost)/ (demand rate *holding cost per item per unit time)
Write a program to compute EQ and TBO, given demand rate (items per unit time), costs (per order) and the holding cost (per item per unit time)




3.	 For a certain electrical circuit with an inductance L and resistance R, the damped natural frequency is given by
                        Frequency = √ (1 / LC – R2 / 4C2)
It is desired to study the variation of this frequency with C (capacitance). Write a program to calculate the frequency for different values of C starting from 0.01 to 0.1 in steps of 0.01




4.	A set of two linear equations with two unknowns x¬1 and x2 is given below:
          Ax1+bx2=m
          Cx2+dx2=n
   	The set has  a unique solution
  		X1= (md+bn)/(ad-cb)
  		X2= (na+mc)/(ad-cb)
Provided the denominator ad-cb is not equal to zero. Write a program that will read the values of constants a, b, c, d, m and n and compute the values of x and x2.An appropriate message should be printed if ad-cb=0



5.	Given a list of marks ranging from 0 to 100.Write  aprogarm to compute and print the number of students who have obtained marks
      a.	In the range 81-100
      b.	In the range 61-80
      c.	In the range 41-61 and
      d.	In the range 0-40
